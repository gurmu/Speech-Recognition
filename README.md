# Speech-Recognition

I strongly recommend to go through the article here to understand the basics of signal processing prior implementing the speech to text.

Understanding the Problem Statement for our Speech-to-Text Project

Let’s understand the problem statement of our project before we move into the implementation part.

We might be on the verge of having too many screens around us. It seems like every day, new versions of common objects are “re-invented” with built-in wifi and bright touchscreens. A promising antidote to our screen addiction is voice interfaces.

TensorFlow recently released the Speech Commands Datasets. It includes 65,000 one-second long utterances of 30 short words, by thousands of different people. We’ll build a speech recognition system that understands simple spoken commands.

You can download the dataset from here.

Implementing the Speech-to-Text Model in Python

The wait is over! It’s time to build our own Speech-to-Text model from scratch.

Import the libraries

First, import all the necessary libraries into our notebook. LibROSA and SciPy are the Python libraries used for processing audio signals.
